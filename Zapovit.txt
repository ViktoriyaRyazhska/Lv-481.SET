The Dnieper's plunging shore
My eyes could see,my ears could hear

When I am dead, bury me
The Dnieper's plunging shore
To the abode of God,
The mighty river roar.

When I am dead, bury me //1

In my beloved Ukraine,//2
//3
//2
In my own beloved Ukraine//3
Amid the spreading plain, //4
So that the fields, the boundless steppes,//5
The Dnieper's plunging shore //6
My eyes could see,my ears could hear //7
The mighty river roar. //8
When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears //9
Into the deep blue sea//10
The blood of foemen — then I’ll leave //11
These hills and fertile fields --//12
I'll leave them all and fly away//13
To the abode of God, //14
//15
I nothing know of God.//16
