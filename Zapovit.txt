When I am dead, bury me //1
//2
In my own beloved Ukraine//3
Amid the spreading plain, //4
//5
The Dnieper's plunging shore //6
My eyes could see,my ears could hear //7
The mighty river roar. //8
When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears //9
//10
//11
These hills and fertile fields --//12
//13
To the abode of God, //14
//15
I nothing know of God.//16
