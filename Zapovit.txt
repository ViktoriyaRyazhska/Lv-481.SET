A fair land and wide
The Dnieper's plunging shore
When I am dead, bury me
The Dnieper's plunging shore
To the abode of God,
My eyes could see,my ears could hear
Amid the spreading plain,
When I am dead, bury me
The Dnieper's plunging shore
To the abode of God,
So that the fields, the boundless steppes,
The mighty river roar.

When I am dead, bury me //1

The Dnieper's plunging shore //6
My eyes could see,my ears could hear //7
The mighty river roar. //8
To the abode of God, //14








I nothing know of God.//16
